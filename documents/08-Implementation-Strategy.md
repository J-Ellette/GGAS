## Modular State Framework

### Architecture Components

**State Configuration Module**
```javascript
const STATE_CONFIG = {
  'TX': {
    agency: 'Railroad Commission of Texas',
    apiEndpoint: 'https://rrc.texas.gov/api',
    authMethod: 'oauth2',
    reports: ['P5', 'W3', 'H1', 'W1', 'W2', 'W3A'],
    frequencies: {
      'P5': 'monthly',
      'W3': 'monthly',
      'H1': 'event-driven'
    },
    calculationMethods: ['well-allocation', 'gor-calculation'],
    validationRules: ['range-check', 'mass-balance'],
    implementationPriority: 1,
    marketSize: 'very-large',
    complexity: 'very-high'
  }
};
```

**Extensible State Module**
```javascript
class StateModule {
  constructor(stateConfig) {
    this.config = stateConfig;
    this.calculator = new CalculationEngine(stateConfig.calculationMethods);
    this.validator = new ValidationEngine(stateConfig.validationRules);
    this.connector = new AgencyConnector(stateConfig.apiEndpoint);
  }
  
  async generateReport(reportType, data) {
    // Calculate using state-specific methods
    const calculated = await this.calculator.calculate(reportType, data);
    
    // Validate against state rules
    const validation = await this.validator.validate(calculated);
    
    if (!validation.passed) {
      return { success: false, errors: validation.errors };
    }
    
    // Format for state agency
    const formatted = this.formatReport(reportType, calculated);
    
    return { success: true, report: formatted };
  }
  
  async submit(report) {
    return await this.connector.submit(report);
  }
}
```
