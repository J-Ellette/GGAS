You may see the following warnings in the developer console:
```
"Request Autofill.enable failed" 
"Request Autofill.setAddresses failed"
```

**Status:** These are harmless warnings from Electron's DevTools and do not affect application functionality. They occur because the Autofill API is not available in all Electron versions and can be safely ignored.
