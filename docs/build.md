5.5 Internationalization (COMPLETE): 
Internationalization in settings panel.
Rules appropriate for country of operation.
The countries listed in this section will need their own language version, selectable in the setting panel.

Nearly all countries involved in oil and gas extraction, production, or significant consumption have specialized accounting needs. The specific rules are heavily influenced by a country's accounting standard—either U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)—and its national tax and regulatory policies. 

Countries using U.S. GAAP:
U.S. GAAP has comprehensive and specific guidance for the oil and gas industry. Companies operating within the United States or those listed on U.S. stock exchanges must follow these rules. 
United States: All publicly traded oil and gas companies operating in the U.S. must adhere to GAAP. U.S. regulations require special accounting for costs related to oil and gas exploration and extraction.
Canada: Canadian companies can choose to use either Canadian GAAP or IFRS. Those operating in the U.S. or with U.S. investors must have a strong understanding of GAAP requirements. 

Countries using IFRS:
More than 140 countries have adopted IFRS, though it offers less specific, more principles-based guidance for the extractive industries. Instead of a single standard, companies use IFRS 6 (Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources) in conjunction with other relevant IFRS standards. 
IFRS-adopting countries: Countries across the European Union, South America, and parts of Asia and Africa have adopted IFRS.
Norway and the United Kingdom: These countries are significant oil and gas producers and, as part of their IFRS adoption, have specific national legislation regarding oil and gas activity.
Indonesia: The Indonesian government has implemented specific tax and regulatory guidance for its oil and gas sector, which has been influenced by its adoption of IFRS.
Other IFRS countries: Key oil and gas nations such as Brazil, Australia, Egypt, Malaysia, and Nigeria operate under IFRS, adding their own national variations to a principles-based framework. 

Countries with unique or state-controlled accounting:
Some major oil and gas nations have unique requirements due to a state-controlled industry or distinct national laws.
Saudi Arabia: The state-owned Saudi Aramco dominates the industry. While the company may report under international standards, the government exercises significant control over the company's financial operations.
Russia: The state-controlled nature of Russia's oil and gas industry means that national regulations and state policies heavily influence accounting practices.
Venezuela: Despite holding the world's largest oil reserves, the oil industry is managed through the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Accounting needs are defined by national regulations, which often diverge from international standards.
China: As the second-largest oil consumer and a major producer, China has complex national regulations for its state-owned oil companies, which include specific accounting requirements.
Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, and the UAE: Many OPEC member states have national oil companies that operate under national laws, which dictate specific accounting and reporting requirements to govern the state's resource interests. 

Accounting complexities for oil and gas:
All oil and gas producing nations need specialized accounting for the following reasons:
Costly exploration: Accounting rules must address how to capitalize or expense large, risky exploration costs.
Reporting of reserves: The estimated quantity and value of proven, probable, and possible reserves must be disclosed.
Depreciation and depletion: The industry requires specific methods for the depreciation and depletion of assets, like the "unit-of-production" method.
International variations: Companies operating across multiple jurisdictions must manage a complex accounting framework that reconciles local tax and reporting requirements with the parent company's home country standards.
Joint ventures: Multi-national projects require complex accounting to track and report costs and revenues for multiple partners. 

Economies with significant oil and gas accounting needs
Economies highly dependent on fuel exports: Countries where fuel exports, including oil and gas, account for a large portion of total exports include Algeria, Azerbaijan, Brunei Darussalam, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Sudan, and Venezuela.
Economies where oil revenue is a large share of GDP: In 2012, World Bank data showed that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Libya relied heavily on oil revenue as a share of their GDP.
Top oil-producing countries: The United States has been the world's largest oil producer since 2018, and its production volume requires extensive accounting. Other major producers include Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Canada.
Countries with large energy exports: Kuwait relies heavily on oil and gas exports for its economic stability, with these resources making up a large portion of its energy system and requiring robust accounting practices.

Then:
Specific accounting standards for the oil and gas industry vary, but the two primary methods for expensing exploration and development costs are the "successful efforts" method and the "full cost" method. U.S. companies follow standards like ASC 932 under GAAP, while countries using IFRS adhere to IFRS 6. 
Methods for expensing exploration and development costs
The choice of accounting method significantly impacts a company's reported earnings and asset values, particularly regarding exploration costs. 
Successful efforts method
What is it: This method capitalizes only the costs associated with successful exploration efforts, such as productive wells. Costs for unsuccessful exploratory efforts, or "dry holes," are immediately expensed.
Impact on financials: This approach typically results in lower asset values and more volatile earnings compared to the full cost method, especially for companies with significant exploration activity.
Governing bodies: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires the use of the successful efforts method under U.S. GAAP. 
Full cost method
What is it: This method capitalizes all exploration operating costs, regardless of whether they were successful or not. These costs are then amortized over time as the total reserves are produced.
Impact on financials: This method can inflate reported net income by deferring the expense of unsuccessful ventures. It generally results in higher asset values and less volatile earnings than the successful efforts method.
Governing bodies: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allows companies to use the full cost method and has specific regulations regarding its use. 
Other relevant accounting standards and considerations
In addition to the two primary methods, other standards and considerations are relevant to oil and gas accounting.
IFRS 6: This International Financial Reporting Standard provides guidance for accounting for the exploration and evaluation of mineral resources. It allows companies to either capitalize or expense costs, provided the chosen policy is applied consistently.
Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization (DD&A): After costs are capitalized, companies use DD&A to expense those costs over time as reserves are extracted.
Reserve accounting: Accurately estimating oil and gas reserves is critical for reporting and asset valuation. The SEC mandates how reserve estimates are used to calculate impairment limitations under the full cost method.
Joint ventures: The industry often uses joint ventures, which have complex accounting rules to manage transactions between multiple parties.
Lease accounting: Newer standards like IFRS 16 and ASC 842 require oil and gas companies to analyze their service arrangements for embedded leases and record right-of-use assets on their balance sheets.
SASB Standards: For environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, companies must disclose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions metrics using standards like those from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).

## **Security Considerations**

### **License Key Security:**
- **Encryption**: Encrypt license keys in database
- **Signing**: Digital signatures to prevent tampering
- **Time-based validation**: Regular re-validation with server
- **Hardware binding**: Tie licenses to specific hardware
- **Anti-tampering**: Detect and prevent license file modifications

### **Communication Security:**
- **HTTPS only**: All communication over secure channels
- **API authentication**: JWT tokens for admin access
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks
- **IP whitelisting**: Optional IP restrictions for enterprise customers

### **Offline Protection:**
- **Grace period**: Limited offline operation (7 days default)
- **Local validation**: Cryptographic validation without server
- **Tamper detection**: Detect system clock manipulation
- **Backup validation**: Multiple validation methods

## **Testing Strategy**

### **Test License Keys:**
```
Development: 123456789abcDEF!4321  (Full features, no expiration)
Trial:       TRIALabcDEF123456789!  (Limited features, 30-day expiration)
Enterprise:  ENTRabcDEF123456789!   (All features, 1-year expiration)
Automated Testing:
javascript// License validation tests
describe('License Validation', () => {
    test('should accept valid test license', async () => {
        const result = await licenseManager.validateLicense('123456789abcDEF!4321');
        expect(result).toBe(true);
    });
    
    test('should reject invalid license', async () => {
        const result = await licenseManager.validateLicense('invalid-key');
        expect(result).toBe(false);
    });
    
    test('should handle offline validation', async () => {
        // Mock network failure
        mockNetworkFailure();
        const result = await licenseManager.validateLicense('123456789abcDEF!4321');
        expect(result).toBe(true); // Should use cached validation
    });
});
