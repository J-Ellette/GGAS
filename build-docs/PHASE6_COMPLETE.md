## Technical Architecture

### Theme Management
**Technology Stack:**
- React Context API for global state
- Material-UI theming system
- LocalStorage for persistence
- MediaQuery API for system detection

**Data Flow:**
1. ThemeProvider wraps entire application
2. ThemeContext provides `themeMode` and `setThemeMode`
3. SettingsPage allows user to change theme
4. Context updates all consuming components
5. Theme preference saved to localStorage
6. System theme changes trigger automatic updates

### Real-Time Data Architecture
**Simulation Approach:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!liveDataEnabled) return;
  
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    // Generate new data point
    const newData = generateRealTimeData();
    
    // Update data stream (keep last 20 points)
    setRealTimeData(prev => [...prev, newData].slice(-20));
    
    // Update current metrics
    setCurrentMetrics(/* calculated metrics */);
  }, 2000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [liveDataEnabled]);
```

**Ready for Real Integration:**
- Replace `setInterval` with WebSocket connection
- Connect to actual SCADA data endpoints
- Integrate IoT sensor APIs
- Link to smart meter data streams
