## Common Use Cases

### Calculating Facility Emissions

1. Add natural gas consumption data
2. Add electricity consumption data
3. Calculate using appropriate emission factors
4. View results on dashboard

### Tracking Fleet Emissions

1. Add gasoline/diesel consumption
2. Use mobile combustion factors
3. Calculate for each vehicle or fleet
4. Monitor trends over time

### Reporting Business Travel

1. Add flight distance data
2. Use air travel factors (short/long haul)
3. Calculate emissions
4. Include in Scope 3 reporting

### Employee Commuting

1. Estimate employee commute distances
2. Use commuting emission factor
3. Calculate annual emissions
4. Track in Scope 3

## GHG Protocol Scopes

### Scope 1: Direct Emissions

Emissions from sources you own or control:

- Boilers and heaters (natural gas, coal)
- Company vehicles (gasoline, diesel)
- Manufacturing processes
- Fugitive emissions (refrigerants, leaks)

### Scope 2: Indirect Energy

Emissions from purchased energy:

- Purchased electricity
- Purchased steam
- Purchased heating/cooling

### Scope 3: Other Indirect

Emissions from your value chain:

- Business travel (flights, rental cars)
- Employee commuting
- Purchased goods and services
- Transportation and distribution
- Waste disposal

## Calculation Methodologies

### Activity-Based

**Best for**: Organizations with detailed operational data

- Uses actual consumption values
- Most accurate method
- Example: 1,000 kWh √ó 0.855 kg CO2e/kWh = 855 kg CO2e

### Spend-Based

**Best for**: Organizations with limited operational data

- Uses financial expenditure
- Less accurate but easier to implement
- Example: $500 electricity √ó 0.4 kg CO2e/$ = 200 kg CO2e

### Hybrid

**Best for**: Complex organizations

- Combines both methods
- Activity-based for major sources
- Spend-based for minor sources

## Data Quality Best Practices

### High Quality (80-100%)

- ‚úÖ Direct meter readings
- ‚úÖ Utility bills with actual usage
- ‚úÖ Recent data (<1 month old)
- ‚úÖ Verified by third party

### Medium Quality (60-79%)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Estimated readings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Industry averages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data 1-6 months old
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Self-reported

### Low Quality (0-59%)

- ‚ùå Rough estimates
- ‚ùå Old data (>6 months)
- ‚ùå Unverified sources
- ‚ùå Incomplete information

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Add Activity Data

- Check all required fields are filled
- Ensure value is a valid number
- Verify data quality is between 0 and 1

### No Emission Factors Found

- Try different search terms
- Check category filter (All/Scope 1/2/3)
- Create custom factor if needed

### Calculation Failed

- Ensure activity data exists
- Verify emission factor is selected
- Check that values are valid numbers

### Dashboard Shows No Data

- Add activity data first
- Perform at least one calculation
- Refresh the dashboard
