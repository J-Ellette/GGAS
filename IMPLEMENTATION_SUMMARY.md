### 5. Documentation ✅
Created and updated comprehensive documentation:

### 6. Error Investigation ✅
**Autofill Console Errors**: Documented and explained

The errors:
```
"Request Autofill.enable failed"
"Request Autofill.setAddresses failed"
```

**Status**: These are harmless warnings from Electron's DevTools. The Autofill API is not available in all Electron versions. They don't affect application functionality and can be safely ignored.

**Documentation**: Added to Known Issues section in README.md

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
1. **License System**: Client-side validation with localStorage for demo purposes
   - Production would use database storage and server-side validation
   - Pattern matching allows for flexible key formats

2. **Admin Panel**: Single-page component with tab-based navigation
   - Material-UI Tabs for clean interface
   - Each tab is a self-contained section
   - Uses existing ElectronAPI for data operations

3. **Type Safety**: Leveraged existing ElectronAPI type definitions
   - Located in `src/common/types/index.ts`
   - Full type coverage for IPC communications

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Webpack build: Successful
- ✅ All existing functionality: Preserved
- ✅ Type safety: Maintained throughout
- ✅ Material-UI components: Consistent design
- ✅ Code organization: Clean separation of concerns
